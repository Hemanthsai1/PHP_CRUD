## Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need to have the following software installed:

PHP (Recommended: PHP 7.4 or higher)
MySQL (or MariaDB)
XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP for local development (Includes PHP, MySQL, and Apache server)
VS Code (or any other code editor)

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hemanthsai1/PHP_CRUD.git


Step 2: Set up the environment
Install XAMPP (or MAMP/WAMP) on your computer.
Place the project folder inside the htdocs folder (for XAMPP) or the appropriate folder for other environments.
Open the XAMPP control panel and start the Apache and MySQL services.


Step 3: Set up the database
Open phpMyAdmin (usually at http://localhost/phpmyadmin/).
Create a new database named school_db.
Run the following SQL queries to create the necessary tables:
sql

CREATE TABLE classes (
    class_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE student (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address TEXT,
    class_id INT,
    image VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (class_id) REFERENCES classes(class_id)
);
Optionally, you can insert some sample data into the classes table:
sql

INSERT INTO classes (name) VALUES ('Class 1'), ('Class 2'), ('Class 3');



Step 4: Configure Database Connection
Ensure that the database connection in the db.php file is configured correctly:

php

<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "";
$dbname = "school_db";

$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
?>


Step 5: Run the Application
Open your browser and go to http://localhost/school_demo/ (replace school_demo with the actual folder name if needed).
You should see the homepage with a list of students and options to manage them.
